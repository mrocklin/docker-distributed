# Kubernetes provisioning of a Dask Distributed cluster

This repo hosts some sample configuration to set up  kubernetes containerized
environments for interactive cluster computing in Python with [Jupyter
notebook](http://jupyter.org/) [dask](http://dask.pydata.org/) distributed
and other tools from the PyData and SciPy
ecosystems.

*This is a work in progress*

The Kubernetes API is provided as a hosted service by:

- [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/)
- [OpenShift by Red Hat](https://www.openshift.com/)

Alternatively it is possible to [install and manage Kubernetes by
your-self](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/).

We will briefly describe usage assuming Google-countainer-engine

## The docker-distributed image

The `Dockerfile` file in this repo can be used to build a docker image
with all the necessary tools to run our cluster, in particular:

- `conda` and `pip` to install additional tools and libraries,
- `jupyter` for the notebook interface accessed from any web browser,
- `dask` and `distributed`,
- `psutil` and `bokeh` (useful for the [cluster monitoring web interface](
   https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web.html))
- many convenient numerical libraries
- interfaces to S3 and GCS medium-term storage solutions

This image will be used to run 3 types of services:

- the `jupyter notebook` server, protected by password `acluster`. This password is defined
in conf/jupyter_notebook_config.py; to change it, you will need to rebuild this image
and point the kubernetes definitions to the new version.
- the `distributed-scheduler` service,
- one `distributed-worker` per container in the compute cluster.


### Setup with Google Container Engine

You will need to install
- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) for authentication and launching 
clusters
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/kubectl/install/) for interacting
with the kubernetes driver.

Register on the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), setup a
billing account and create a project with the Google Compute Engine API enabled.

Ensure that your client SDK is up to date:

```
$ gcloud components update
```

Make any changes you may require in 
- scripts/make_cluster.sh, such as the number of
nodes or [machine types](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) and region
- kubernetes/distributed.yaml, settings for the number of workers and their parameters. Note
that if you allocate more resources than your cluster can handle, some pods will not start;
even if you use auto-scaling, additional nodes are only launched when CPU usage on existing
nodes rises.

When ready, launch with one command:
```bash
> source scripts/make_cluster.sh
```

This will take some time. Next, wait for the pods to come online. You can repeatedly
run
```bash
> kubectl get pods -l app=distributed
```

and you will see something like

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
dask-scheduler-hebul     0/1       ContainerCreating   0          32s
dask-worker-2dpr1        0/1       ContainerCreating   0          32s
...
jupyter-notebook-z58dm   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          32s
```

When everything turns READY, check the IP of the notebok server

```bash
> kubectl get services -l app=distributed


NAME               CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)          AGE
jupyter-notebook   10.51.252.116   99.99.99.99    8888:30651/TCP   1m
dask-scheduler     10.51.252.117   99.99.99.98    8787:...
```

For this output, you can access the UI by pointing a browser to 99.99.99.99:8888.
You can connect to the distributed scheduler by doing
```python
from dask.distributed import Client
c = Client('dask-scheduler:8786')
```

You can view the bokeh dashboards in a browser on 99.99.99.98:8787 and 99.99.99.97:8788 and
you can connect to the scheduler from *outside* of the cluster by doing
```python
from dask.distributed import Client
c = Client('99.99.99.98:8786')
```


When you are done, delete the cluster with


```
$ gcloud container clusters delete distributed-1
```



## Extras

we can get the logs of a specific pod with `kubectl logs`:

```
$ kubectl logs -f dask-scheduler-hebul
distributed.scheduler - INFO - Scheduler at:       10.115.249.189:8786
distributed.scheduler - INFO -      http at:       10.115.249.189:9786

distributed.scheduler - INFO - Register 10.112.1.4:54760
distributed.scheduler - INFO - Starting worker compute stream, 10.112.1.4:54760
```

we can also execute arbitrary commands inside the running containers with
`kubectl exec`, for instance to open an interactive shell session for debugging
purposes:

```
$ kubectl exec -ti dask-scheduler-hebul bash
root@dscheduler-hebul:/work# ls -l examples/
total 56
-rw-r--r-- 1 basicuser root  1344 May 17 11:29 distributed_joblib_backend.py
-rw-r--r-- 1 basicuser root 33712 May 17 11:29 sklearn_parameter_search.ipynb
-rw-r--r-- 1 basicuser root 14407 May 17 11:29 sklearn_parameter_search_joblib.ipynb
```
